Create a short text adventure that will call the user by their name.
The text adventure should use standard text adventure commands ("l, n, s, e, i, etc.").
  MOVE NORTH (N){?}
For extra credit, make sure the program doesn't fault, quit, glitch, fail, or loop no matter what is put in, even empty text or spaces.
These will be tested rigorously!
For super extra credit, code it in C.
OPT: Create/use a format for create your own text adventures!
Example below:


@ START
>An army of zombies is approaching your house. What will you do?
- B - LEAVE FROM THE BACK DOOR - BACK_DOOR
- F - LEAVE FROM THE FRONT DOOR - FRONT_DOOR
- D - STAY AND DEFEND YOUR HOUSE - DEFEND

This and any other line that doesn't start with a command symbol is a comment.
@ BACK_DOOR
> You exited your house from the back door. What will you do?
- R - GO RIGHT - RIGHT
- L - GO LEFT -  LEFT

@ RIGHT
= DIE

@ LEFT
= DIE

@ FRONT_DOOR
> You exited your house through the front door, the zombies are everywhere!
= DIE

@ DEFEND
> How do you want to defend your home?
- K - USE A KNIFE - KNIFE
- S - USE A SHOTGUN - SHOTGUN

@ KNIFE
> The zombies are too many.
= DIE

@ SHOTGUN
> You take the shotgun.
= DIE

@ DIE
> You die.



Indentation is up to the user.
'@' are function definitions, '>' are print statements, '=' are function calls, and '-' are option lists.
An option list looks like this:
[KEY] - [DESCRIPTION] - [FUNCTION NAME]
You can fire your favorite text editor up and start writing your text adventure game.
Then, assuming you save your story as adventure.story: gcc Cadventure-txt.c -o cadventure ./cadventure adventure.story
