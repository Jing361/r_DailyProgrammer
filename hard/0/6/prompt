quote:
Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap.

The normal game is between two players and played with three heaps of any number of objects. The two players alternate taking any number of objects from any single one of the heaps. The goal is to be the last to take an object. In mis√®re play, the goal is instead to ensure that the opponent is forced to take the last remaining object.

The following example game is played between fictional players Bob and Alice who start with heaps of three, four and five objects.
